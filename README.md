# FourtyTwo

This was an old bot I made and the code isn't the best, you can tell by the "present e !" comments I've added before uploading this to github.

## Hosting the Bot

This bot uses a token.txt file to store the token which is super stupid so you'll have to add that! Next you just run it with `node index.js` because I for whatever reason didn't use init so there's no package.json or anything, make sure your Discord.js is v13.
